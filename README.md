# KISS Package Experiment.

This is an alternative package system I am experimenting with. Instead of the usual `PKGBUILD`, `APKBUILD`, `xbps-template` and `Pkgfile` format, this repository explores a more unixy approach.

Each Package is split into multiple files.

```sh
zlib/            # Package name.
├─ build         # Build script.
├─ depends       # Dependencies (one per line).
├─ sources       # Sources (one per line).
├─ version       # Package version.
┘

# Files generated by the package manager.
├─ manifest      # The built package's files and directories.
├─ checksums     # The checksums for the source files.
┘

# Optional files.
├─ post_install  # The script to run after install.
├─ release       # Force a package update for the same version.
┘
```
